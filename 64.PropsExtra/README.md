A better and more meaningful commit message than just "few files removed" would clearly indicate **what** files were removed and **why**, even briefly.

Here are a few good formats you can use:

---

### ✅ General Improvements:

* `chore: remove unused files`
* `refactor: clean up unused components/files`
* `cleanup: deleted redundant files`
* `remove: old test files and unused assets`
* `fix: removed unnecessary files causing clutter`

---

### 🔍 More Specific (if you know what you removed):

* `remove: deleted legacy login page and old assets`
* `cleanup: removed unused Card component and styles`
* `chore: removed demo files from initial setup`

---

### 📌 If it's part of a bigger task:

* `feat: cleanup project structure, removed old files`
* `refactor: simplified folder structure by deleting obsolete files`

---

### 💡 Format Tip:

> Use a prefix like `feat`, `fix`, `chore`, `refactor`, `remove`, or `cleanup` to help categorize your commits better. Most teams follow this format for clarity.
