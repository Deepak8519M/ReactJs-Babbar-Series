Absolutely! Here's a **useful commit message format** that many developers follow â€” especially in **collaborative or professional projects** â€” based on [Conventional Commits](https://www.conventionalcommits.org/).

---

### âœ… Basic Format:

```
<type>(optional scope): <short summary>

<optional longer description>
```

---

### ðŸ”¹ Common `<type>` values:

| Type       | Purpose                                                 |
| ---------- | ------------------------------------------------------- |
| `feat`     | A new feature                                           |
| `fix`      | A bug fix                                               |
| `style`    | Changes to styling, CSS, or formatting (not logic)      |
| `refactor` | Code changes that neither fix a bug nor add a feature   |
| `docs`     | Changes to documentation only                           |
| `test`     | Adding or modifying tests                               |
| `chore`    | Maintenance tasks (e.g., updating dependencies, config) |
| `perf`     | Performance improvements                                |

---

### ðŸ’¡ Examples:

#### âœ… Small CSS/Style changes:

```bash
git commit -m "style(card): updated hover effect for cards"
```

#### âœ… Added new feature (e.g., animated form):

```bash
git commit -m "feat(form): added popping animation to form using Framer Motion"
```

#### âœ… Fixed a bug (e.g., form not closing):

```bash
git commit -m "fix(form): fixed form not closing on outside click"
```

#### âœ… Changed structure or cleaned up:

```bash
git commit -m "refactor: extracted card component for reusability"
```

#### âœ… Updated README or docs:

```bash
git commit -m "docs: added project description and screenshot to README"
```

#### âœ… Added image to assets:

```bash
git commit -m "chore: moved screenshot to public/assets for README"
```

---

### ðŸ§  Bonus Tip:

Use `git log` after a few commits â€” a clean history like this really helps:

```
feat: add animated popup form
style: update card layout and colors
fix: correct bug with form submission
docs: add README.md with screenshot
```

---

Of course! Here's **more commit message examples** for **different types of work** you might do in a typical React or frontend project using Tailwind, Framer Motion, etc.

### ðŸ§  Pro Tips:

- **Commit often**, but keep each commit **focused** (e.g., don't mix a CSS fix with a new feature).
- Use `git add -p` (patch mode) to commit specific changes selectively.
- Keep your summary under 50 characters when possible.
- You can write detailed explanations under the short message by adding a blank line, like this:

```
feat(form): added animation

Used Framer Motion to animate the entry and exit of the form.
This improves UX and feels more interactive.
```
