## 🔹 `public/assets` vs `src/assets` in a React project

### 🗂️ 1. `public/assets`

* These files are **publicly accessible**.
* You can reference them **directly by URL** in your HTML or JSX.

#### ✅ Use when:

* You want to include images, favicons, or files that don’t change during the build.
* You want to load files with static paths (`/assets/img.png`).

#### Example:

If you have this file:

```
public/assets/TicTacToeRjs.png
```

You can use it like this:

```jsx
<img src="/assets/TicTacToeRjs.png" alt="Screenshot" />
```

> ⚠️ Do **not** use `import` for images in `public/`.

---

### 🗂️ 2. `src/assets`

* These are part of your **module system**, meaning they go through the **build process (webpack/Vite)**.
* You must **import** them to use in React.

#### ✅ Use when:

* You want React/Vite to **optimize or bundle** your images.
* You need tighter control over the assets used in components.

#### Example:

If your file is:

```
src/assets/TicTacToeRjs.png
```

You must do:

```jsx
import myImg from './assets/TicTacToeRjs.png';

<img src={myImg} alt="Screenshot" />
```

### 🧠 Summary:

| Feature                | `public/assets`             | `src/assets` |
| ---------------------- | --------------------------- | ------------ |
| Accessed via URL       | ✅ Yes (`/assets/image.png`) | ❌ No         |
| Needs `import`         | ❌ No                        | ✅ Yes        |
| Included in build tool | ❌ No                        | ✅ Yes        |
| Good for dynamic files | ❌ No                        | ✅ Yes        |
| Cached and optimized   | ❌ No                        | ✅ Yes        |

### 🧩 When to use what?

* For README images or external linking → use `public/assets`.
* For component-based local use → use `src/assets`.

---

No problem! Let me explain **deeply and clearly** with visuals in mind.

---

## 🧠 First, What are `public/` and `src/` folders in React?

### 🗂️ `public/` Folder:

* This folder is for **static files**.
* These files are **not processed by React**.
* Files stay the **same** in the final build.
* They are accessed **directly by URL** (like a website folder).

✅ Good for:

* Images used in README.
* Favicon (browser tab icon).
* Any file you want to access directly via a link.

---

### 🗂️ `src/` Folder:

* This is where all your **React code lives**.
* Images in here are **processed and bundled** by React tools (like Vite or Webpack).
* You need to **import** the image before using it.

✅ Good for:

* Images used **inside React components**.
* Code-managed or dynamic images.

---

## 🔍 Visual Example:

Assume this folder structure:

```
project/
├── public/
│   └── assets/
│       └── myImage.png
├── src/
│   └── assets/
│       └── myImage2.png
```

---

### ✅ Using image from `public/assets`:

* You do **NOT** import this.
* You use a **direct path**:

```jsx
<img src="/assets/myImage.png" alt="Image from public" />
```

🧠 Why `/assets/myImage.png`?

Because during build, everything inside `public/` is served as-is from the root (`/`).

So if you write `./TicTacToeRjs.png` — that’s wrong unless your file is **directly inside public**.

---

### ✅ Using image from `src/assets`:

* You **must import** this image:

```jsx
import myImg from '../assets/myImage2.png';

<img src={myImg} alt="Image from src" />
```

🧠 Why do we import?

Because React uses build tools (like Vite) to **optimize** and **bundle** your images. Importing tells React: “Hey, use this file.”

## 🎯 Summary Table

| Feature                       | `public/assets/`              | `src/assets/`          |
| ----------------------------- | ----------------------------- | ---------------------- |
| Can use directly in README    | ✅ Yes                         | ❌ No                   |
| Can be accessed by URL        | ✅ Yes (`/assets/myImage.png`) | ❌ No (`import` needed) |
| Requires `import` in React    | ❌ No                          | ✅ Yes                  |
| Processed by React build tool | ❌ No                          | ✅ Yes (gets optimized) |
| Good for README or static use | ✅ Best                        | ❌ Not preferred        |
| Good for React component UI   | ❌ Not good                    | ✅ Best                 |

## ❌ Common mistake:

```md
![Screenshot](./TicTacToeRjs.png)
```

❌ This will not work unless `TicTacToeRjs.png` is in the **same folder as the `.md` file** or you give full path like:

```md
![Screenshot](/assets/TicTacToeRjs.png)
```

---

## ✅ Fix your README image:

1. Place your image inside:

```
public/assets/TicTacToeRjs.png
```

2. In your `README.md`, use:

```md
![Tic Tac Toe Screenshot](/assets/TicTacToeRjs.png)
```

That's it. It will now show the image on GitHub or browser.
